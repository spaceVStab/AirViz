Call Graphs Visualization Platform </br>
This visualizer application is designed for any node-link graph based on D3.js 
## Setup
Run the following:
```
$ python install -r requirements.txt
$ cd app/
$ python app.py
```
The application is running at localhost:5000 </br>
As of now the application uses a dot (graphviz) type file which may not be the one your graph might be in. Soon the one which uses json files as the input graph file will be committed.
